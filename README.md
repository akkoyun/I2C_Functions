**Abstract**

This is a helper library to abstract away I2C transactions and registers.

```C++
// Declare Object
I2C_Functions HDC2010(__I2C_Addr_HDC2010__, true, __Mux_Channel_3__);
```

Library includes some helper I2C functions and a generic I2C multiplexer function.

    * Read_Register
    * Write_Register
    * Read_Multiple_Register
    * Write_Multiple_Register
    * Write_Command
    * Set_Register_Bit
    * Clear_Register_Bit
    * Read_Register_Bit
    * BCDtoDEC
    * DECtoBCD
    * Control_Device
    * Detect
    * Address
    * Mux
    * Set_Multiplexer

**Scanner**

This very simple sketch scans the I2C-bus for devices. If a device is found, it is reported to the Arduino serial monitor.

This sketch is the first step to get the I2C communication working.

The sketch shows the 7-bit addresses of the found devices as hexadecimal values. That value can be used for the "Wire.begin" function which uses the 7-bit address. Some datasheets use the 8-bit address and some example sketches use decimal addresses.

This scanner supports I2C multiplexer and can be used for channel selection.
