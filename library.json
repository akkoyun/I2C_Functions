	"description": "The Two-Wire interface is extremely useful for connecting multiple devices, as they can all share the same two pins (plus a ground return). This is because the devices are \"addressable\". Each device needs to have a unique address in the range 0x03 to 0x77. This is a helper library to abstract away I2C transactions and registers also this tool scans the master I2C bus and reports connected devices. ",
